# Weaker than you think
This repository contains the code for paper [Weaker Than You Think: A Critical Look at Weakly Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17442) (ACL 2023)

## TLDR

1. We demonstrate that the success of existing weakly supervised learning approaches heavily relies on the availability of clean validation samples. 
2. We show these can be leveraged much more efficiently by simply training on them. 


## Update
2023.07.10: Working on code clean up ðŸ§¹. Code will be online soon, please stay tuned! ðŸ™Œ
